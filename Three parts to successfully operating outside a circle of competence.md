Take the time to do a bit of research to at least define questions you need to ask, and what information you need, to make a good decision. if you ask person to answer the question for you, they'll be giving a fish. If you ask them detailed and thoughtful questions, you'll learn how to fish. Furthermore, when you need the advice of others, especially in higher stakes situations, ask questions to probe the limits of their circles. Than ask yourself how the situation might influence the information they choose to provide you

These will help you identify the foundational concepts that would be most useful. These then serve as a guide to help you navigate the situation you are in
