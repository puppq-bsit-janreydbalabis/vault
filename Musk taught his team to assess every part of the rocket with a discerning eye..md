>*Musk taught his team to assess every part of the rocket with a discerning eye. Brian Bjelde remembers being constantly challenged.

>The SpaceX attitude was different. “True, a product may already exist,” Bjelde said. “But is it optimized for your solution? Is it from a good supplier? And what about their tier two or tier three suppliers? And if you need more of them faster, will they meet your needs? If you want to change something, are they going to be willing to change it? And if you improve that product, will they then sell it to your competitors?”
