# Vertical integration will enable you to control the quality, cost and supply chain of your company

>*One of the most important decisions that Elon Musk made about Tesla—the defining imprint that led it to its success and its impact on the auto industry — was that it should make its own key components, rather than piecing together a car with hundreds of components from independent suppliers. Tesla would control its own destiny—and quality and costs and supply chain—by being vertically integrated.  Creating a good car was important. Even more important was creating the manufacturing process and factories that could mass-produce them, from the battery cells to the body.
