# Curiosity is a virtue

>*Curiosity is a virtue, and it's good to look for answers to "Why" questions whenever we might be able to find them, or when we think that asking such questions might help us to understand things better. But we should be at peace with the possibility that for some questions, the answer doesn't go any deeper than "That's what it is". We're not used to thatâ€”our intuition assures as that every event can be explained in terms of some reason why. To understand why we have that impression, we need to dig more deeply  into how our actual universe has evolved
