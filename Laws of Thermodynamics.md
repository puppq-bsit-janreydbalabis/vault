# Laws of Thermodynamics

1. **Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics**:  
   If two objects are each in thermal equilibrium with a third object (like a thermometer), they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.  
   *Simple version*: If two things have the same temperature as a third thing, they have the same temperature as each other. This is why thermometers work!

2. **First Law of Thermodynamics**:  
   Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted from one form to another. The total energy in a system stays constant.  
   *Simple version*: Energy is like money—you can spend it, save it, or change it (like from cash to credit), but the total amount doesn’t vanish or appear out of nowhere. For example, the energy in a moving car comes from the fuel it burns.

3. **Second Law of Thermodynamics**:  
   In any energy transfer or transformation, some energy becomes unusable (often as heat), increasing the disorder (entropy) of the universe.  
   *Simple version*: Things naturally get messier over time. When you use energy (like burning fuel), some of it gets “wasted” as heat, and you can’t use it all perfectly. It’s why perpetual motion machines don’t work.

4. **Third Law of Thermodynamics**:  
   As a system approaches absolute zero temperature (-273.15°C or 0 Kelvin), its entropy (disorder) approaches a minimum value.  
   *Simple version*: At the coldest possible temperature (absolute zero), things are as “orderly” as they can get, with almost no random movement of particles.
