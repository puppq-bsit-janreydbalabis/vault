# Science is done by people, so it has human flaws. When science doesn't move forward, it's often because scientists are stuck in their ways, not because there aren't enough facts

>*Science is not a superhuman activity immune to the foibles of human nature. Lack of progress in science is never so much due to any sparsity of factual information as it is to the fixed mindsets of scientists themselves
