# Should we give AI goals

>* Should we give AI goals, and if so, whose goals? How can we give AI goals? Can we ensure that these goals are retained even if the AI gets smarter? Can we change the goals of an AI that’s smarter than us? What are our ultimate goals? These questions are not only difficult, but also crucial for the future of life: <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">if we don’t know what we want, we’re less likely to get it, and if we cede control to machines that don’t share our goals, then we’re likely to get what we don’t want.</mark>
