# We can change the world

>*Changing the world is no mean feat; but this quote reveals two of great truths of the world. First, the world can be changed . Second, every great movement in the world starts with a tiny group of people who simple refuse to accept a situation . They gather their ideas and their passion and drive forward. If there is a problem they solve it or simply overcome it. They are not intimidated by the odds.
