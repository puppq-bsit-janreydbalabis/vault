# Criticize the action not the person

>*"I give people hardcore feedback, ,mostly accurate, and I try not to do it in a way that's ad hominem," he says. "I try to criticize the action not the person. We all make mistakes. What matters is whether a person has a good feedback loop, can seek criticism from others, and can improve. Physics does not care about hurt feelings. It cares about whether you got the rocket right."
