# Question all specifications

>*One reason was that rocket components were subject to hundreds of specifications and requirements mandated by NASA . At big aerospace companies, engineers followed theses religiously. Musk did the opposite: he made the engineers <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">question all specifications</mark>. Whenever one of his engineers cited as "requirement" as a reason for doing something. Musk would grill them: Who made that requirement? And answering "The military" or "The legal department" was not good enough. Musk would insist that they know the name of the actual person who made the requirement.  <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">All requirements should be treated as recommendations. The only immutable one were those dictated by physics</mark>
