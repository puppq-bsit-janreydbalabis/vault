# Don't separate the engineering team from the designer team. The designer team should feel the immediate pain when their design is hard to engineer

>*Musk restructured the company so that there was not a separate engineering department. Instead, engineers would team up with product managers. It was a philosophy that he would carry through to Tesla, SpaceX, and then Twitter. Separating the design of a product from its engineering was recipe for dysfunction. Designers had to feel the immediate pain if something they devised was hard to engineer.
