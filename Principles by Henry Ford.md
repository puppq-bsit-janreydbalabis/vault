# Principles by Henry Ford

>**No fear of the future, no obsession with the past.** 
>If you’re scared of what’s ahead or stuck worshiping what’s behind, you’re not moving forward. Failure? It’s just a data point to iterate smarter. There’s no shame in failing if you’re pushing boundaries—shame is in not trying. The past is only useful if it fuels progress, not nostalgia.

>**Forget competition, focus on being the best.** 
>The one who nails it should win. Trying to tear others down to get ahead is weak—it’s using brute force instead of brains. Build something so good it stands alone.

>**Service over profit. Profit’s not the goal; it’s the outcome.** 
>A business that solves real problems and delivers value can’t help but make money. But if you chase profit first, you’re doing it backward. Serve, and the rest follows.

>**Manufacturing is transformation, not arbitrage.**
> It’s not about buying cheap and selling high. It’s taking raw materials, adding minimal cost, and turning them into something people need. That’s how you create real value, not just shuffle money around.
