# How to get things done 

>*In early 2019 the South Texas team began fabricating a miniature Starship prototype nicknamed Starhopper. After this stubby vehicle made short test flights in July and August 2019, SpaceX retired it. A few months later, Muratore took a break from SpaceX, and Rench found himself in the role of site director, reporting directly to Musk. It completed a rapid rise for an electronics engineer who had been fixing amusement park rides at SeaWorld in Florida a few years earlier.

>Musk would often fly to South Texas on weekends, spending Saturday night at the launch site to check on its progress and prodding where needed. On one Sunday morning, at 2 or 3 in the morning, Rench and Musk were discussing plans to build a Starship factory. Musk liked what he heard so much that he was ready to start. Right then.

>“He told me to call the concrete guy,” Rench said. “He was like, ‘I’m here, so he needs to be here.’ And so I called the concrete guy, the company that we used, and of course there was no answer.”

><mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">This is how Musk gets things done. When he makes a decision, it is implemented immediately. Rightly or wrongly, there are no committees. He is a committee of one. This is a key reason why SpaceX moves so quickly.
