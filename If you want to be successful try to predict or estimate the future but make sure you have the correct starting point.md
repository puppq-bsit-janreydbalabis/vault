# If you want to be successful try to predict or estimate the future but make sure you have the correct starting point

>*In many systems, the situation is such that under some conditions chaotic events take place, That means that, given a particular starting point, it is impossible to predict outcomes. This is true even in some quite simple systems, but the more complex a system, the more likely it is to become chaotic. It has always been assumed that anything as complicated as human society would quickly become chaotic and, therefore, unpredictable. What I have done, however, is to show that, in studying human society, it is possible to choose a starting point and to make appropriate assumptions that will suppress the chaos. That will make it possible to predict the future, no in full detail, of course, but in broad sweeps; not with certainty, but with calculable probabilities.

>To do more, we would actually have to choose a correct starting point, make correct assumptions, and then find ways of carrying through calculations in a finite time.

>Every successful politician, businessman, or human being of any calling must make these estimates of the future and do it fairly well or he or she would not be successful.
