# Only the outcome will get rewarded

>*SpaceX pioneered an alternative in which private companies bid on performing a specific task or mission, such as launching government payloads to orbit. The company risked its own capital, and it would be paid only if and when it delivered on certain milestones. This outcomes-based fixed-price contracting allowed the private company to control, within broad parameters, how its rockets were designed and built. There was a lot of money to be made if it built a cost-efficient rocket that succeeded, and a lot of money to be lost if it failed. "It rewards results rather than waste"
