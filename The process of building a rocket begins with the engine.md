# The process of building a rocket begins with the engine

>*The process of building a rocket begins with the engine. After all, engine is the root word of engineer. In principle, a rocket's propulsion system is simple: An oxidizer and fuel flow from their respective tanks into an injector, which mixes them as they enter the combustion chamber. Inside this chamber, the fuels ignite and burn, producing a superhot exhaust gas. The engine's nozzle channels the flow of this exhaust in the opposite direction a rocket is meant to go. Newton's Third Law of Motion—for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction—does the rest.
