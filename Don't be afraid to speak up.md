# Don't be afraid to speak up

>*Everybody has a voice. Activate your sense of personal responsibility. You have agency. Participate. Do not be a bystander as truth, reason, and logic call out for your help. Do not subcontract your voice to others. Do not self censor. You and your children have a stake in the outcome of this battle, so don't be afraid to speak up.
