# Aways try to make predictions

>*We have to have the ability to conceive of times in the future, not merely the present moment. We need to be able to represent the actions both ourselves and the rest of the world in our mental pictures. We must reliably predict the future actions and their likely responses. Finally, we must be able to do this for multiple scenarios simultaneously, and eventually compare and choose between them.
>The ability to plan ahead seems so basic that we take it for granted, but it's quite a marvelous capacity of human mind
