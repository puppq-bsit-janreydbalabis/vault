# Ultra Hardcore

>*One of Musk's favorite words—and concepts— was "hardcore." He used it to describe the workplace culture he wanted when he founded ZIp2, and he would use it almost thirty years later when he upended the nurturing culture of Twitter. As the Model S production line ramped up, he spelled out his creed in a quintessential email to employees, titled "Ultra hardcore." It read, "Please prepare yourself for a level of intensity that is greater than anything most of you have experienced before. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Revolutionizing industries is not for the paint of heart</mark>"
