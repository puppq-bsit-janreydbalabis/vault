# Business is a collection of people who are brought together to do work and not to write letters to one another

>*It is not necessary for any one department to know what any other department is doing. If a man is doing his work he will not have time to take up any other work. It is the business of those who plan the entire work to see that all of the departments are working properly toward the same end. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">It is not necessary to have meetings to establish good feeling between individuals or departments. It is not necessary for people to love each other to work together. Too much good fellowship may indeed be a very bad thing, for it may lead to one man trying to cover up the faults of another. That is bad for both men. </mark>
