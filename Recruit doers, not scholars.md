# Recruit doers, not scholars

>*As he thought about his future career, Dunn did not know what step to take next. Perhaps, he figured, his best chance to work at SpaceX was to first earn a master’s degree, and then a Ph.D. in rocket science, to really become a subject matter expert. He enrolled at Stanford University for this very purpose. Dunn made friends with a student group working on a hybrid rocket with elements of both solid and liquid propulsion. Dunn threw himself into this project, meeting an MBA candidate named Eric Romo who had worked at SpaceX from January 2003 through early 2004 on propulsion.

>In talking to Romo, Dunn realized that pursuing a doctorate in rocket science was the wrong approach. The company wanted doers, not scholars. He should get as much hands-on experience as possible while pursuing a master’s degree
