# To be critical is to show good judgement

>*The critical-thinking tradition is concerned primarily with epistemic adequacy. To be critical is to show good judgement in recognizing when arguments are faulty, assertions lack evidence, truth claims appeal to unreliable sources, or concepts are sloppily crafted and applied. For critical thinkers, the problem is that people fail to " to examine the assumptions, commitments and logic of daily life... the basic problem is irrational, illogical, and unexamined living"
