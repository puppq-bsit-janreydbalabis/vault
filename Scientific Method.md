# Scientific Method

*The way that science goes about narrowing down our world from an infinite number of possible one is pretty clear: by looking at it. Performing observations and experiments, gathering data, and using that to increase our credence in the useful, explanatory theories

>**Observe:** 
>*Closely observe the physical world about you. Recognize a question or a puzzle—such as an unexplained observation

>**Questions:**
>*Make an educated guess—a hypothesis—that might resolve the puzzle

>**Predict:**
>*Predict consequences of the hypothesis

>**Test Predictions:**
>*Do experiments or make calculations to test the predictions

>**Draw a Conclusion:**
>*Formulate the simplest general rule that organizes the three main ingredients: hypothesis, predicted effects, and experimental findings
