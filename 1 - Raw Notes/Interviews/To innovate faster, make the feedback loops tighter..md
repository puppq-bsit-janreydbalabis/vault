# To innovate faster, make the feedback loops tighter.

>*There has to be a tight feedback loop on innovation.  One of the things that is advantageous for the way SpaceX operates is that the engineering team and the production team are in the same facility, and there is good communication back and forth.  As the engineers see that they've designed something that is difficult to manufacture, they can adjust their design quickly, to make it easier to build.  The pace at which we're able to do new versions of the rocket is also much faster.”
