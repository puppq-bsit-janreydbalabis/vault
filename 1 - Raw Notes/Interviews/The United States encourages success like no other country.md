# The United States encourages success like no other country

>*I think the United States is more open to new ideas than any country in the world. It becomes s self-fulfilling prophecy: because the United States is open to new ideas, it attracted people from around the world who had new ideas. So, now it's full of people who like new ideas, who aren't bound by history. A lot of the countries that have been around for a long time are really trapped in their own history. And the United States is also a great melting pot of different cultures, ideas and thoughts. It's a country which tends to encourage success. You see someone that did extremely well, and generally, the reaction in the United States is, good for that person. In most countries, that's not the reaction. People tend to think, that person did well because they screwed somebody else or they tried to rise beyond their station. That was really inappropriate of them to be so 'nouveau riche', to use a French word.
