# If something's really important, one should overcome the fear and just do it

>*“I wouldn't say I'm fearless. In fact, I think I feel fear quite strongly. But if what we're doing is important enough, then I just override the fear.  If the stakes are high, if it's really important, then one should overcome the fear and just do it anyway. Essentially, drive overrides fear. But I feel the fear. It's kind of annoying. I wish I felt it less.”
