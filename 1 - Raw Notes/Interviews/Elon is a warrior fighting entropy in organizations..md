# Elon is a warrior fighting entropy in organizations.

>*“He hates meetings. He keeps telling people to skip meetings if they're not useful. He has a very good intuition for streamlining processes, making everything efficient —the best part is no part— simplifying, focusing, and just removing barriers, moving very quickly, and making big moves. I do think you need someone in a powerful position with a big hammer like Elon, who's the cheerleader for that idea and ruthlessly pursues it. If no one has a big enough hammer, everything turns into committees, democracy within the company, processes, talking to stakeholders, decision-making, everything just crumbles. If you have a big person who is also really smart and has a big hammer, things move quickly.”
