>Elon: “I don't know. I just meet with my team and we go around the table and talk about what everyone got done this past week and what they plan to do next week, and then try to make some decisions about product design and direction or solve some particular technology problem. They're quite collegial. It's not me talking. I talk the least of the meetings.”
