# A useful life is a good life, a life worth having lived

>*Try to live a useful life. Do things that are useful to your fellow human beings, to the world.  It's very hard to be useful, very hard.  Are you contributing more than you consume? Can you try to have a positive net contribution to society? I think that's the thing to aim for. Not to try to be a leader for the sake of being a leader.  If you live a useful life, that is a good life, a life worth having lived.
