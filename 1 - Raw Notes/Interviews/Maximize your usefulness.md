# Maximize your usefulness

>*“Generally, just try to make a good product or service. It's really that. You have to say, what is a useful thing that you could do? Maximize your usefulness. If you want to make the best beef jerky, just go ahead and do it. First of all, you need to make sure it is, in fact, the best beef jerky. And then, you just need to explain to people why it is. And so, if you have both the reality and the perception of something being the best beef jerky, or whatever the product may be, then I think you'll find it to be very successful.”
