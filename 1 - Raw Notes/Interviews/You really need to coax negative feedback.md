# You really need to coax negative feedback.

>*It's very important to actively seek out and listen very carefully to negative feedback. This is something that people tend to avoid because it's painful. When friends get a product, I say, don't tell me what you like, tell me what you don't like. Because otherwise, your friend is not going to tell you what he doesn't like. He's going to say, oh, I love this and that, and then leave out the this-is-the-stuff-I-don't-like list, because he wants to be your friend, he doesn't want to offend you. So, you really need to coax negative feedback. You know that if somebody is your friend, or at least not your enemy, and they're giving you negative feedback, they may be wrong, but it's coming from a good place. And sometimes, even your enemies give you good negative feedback.
