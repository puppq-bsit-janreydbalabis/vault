# I'm trying to understand the universe and what we are here for

>*“The reason I believe in truth and honesty is because I'm trying to understand the universe. I'm trying to understand reality. I'm trying to understand what's the meaning of life, what we are here for, what's going on. If you're not rigorous about truth and honesty, then you're obviously going to live in a deluded world. You won't understand the nature of reality.”
