# In order to remember something, you must assign meaning to it.

>*“In order to remember something, you must assign meaning to it. If you can say why something is relevant, you probably will remember it. Your brain is constantly trying to forget everything as much as possible, because it's hard to store memories. Most of the stuff that we see and hear is not worth remembering.”
