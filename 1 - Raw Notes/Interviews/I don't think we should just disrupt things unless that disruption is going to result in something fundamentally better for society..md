# I don't think we should just disrupt things unless that disruption is going to result in something fundamentally better for society.

>*I'm not a fan of disruption. I'm just a fan of things being better. “I'm not actually a fan of disruption for its own sake. If there's a need for something to be disrupted and it's important to the future of the world, then sure, then we should disrupt it. I don't think we should just disrupt things unless there's something, unless that disruption is going to result in something fundamentally better for society. A lot of people think I'm a fan of disruption, but I'm not really a fan of disruption. I'm just a fan of things being better.”
