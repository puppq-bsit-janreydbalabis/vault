# Revolutionary innovation is driven by small, dedicated teams, not by big companies.

>*“Big companies are not very good at revolutionary innovation. They're okay when it comes to incremental things here and there, but they have a real problem with taking the next leap forward. Somebody needs to lead the way. A smaller company needs to lead the way. We have to appreciate what is really the constraint. Is the constraint a quantity of resources? It's not the quantity of resources. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Is there a small, very talented, focused, dedicated team that's willing to take the risks and make something happen? That's the scarce commodity, not money. </mark>The world is awash in money.”
