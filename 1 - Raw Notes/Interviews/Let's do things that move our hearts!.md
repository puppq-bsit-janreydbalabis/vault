# Let's do things that move our hearts!

>*Elon Musk: 
>Let's do things that move our hearts! “Life cannot just be about solving one problem after another. We need things that inspire us. We need things that move our hearts. That, when you wake up in the morning, you're excited to be alive. Being a space-faring civilization and making true the things that we see in the good science fiction movies, this is one of the things that I think can inspire all of humanity. Just like when the astronauts went to the moon in 1969, it was something. They said: 'For all mankind'. And it really was something ... You say to any human on Earth, what's the most amazing thing that humanity has ever done? At least one of those things would be, we went to the moon. And so, you want to have these inspiring things that make you excited to be alive, excited about the future.”
