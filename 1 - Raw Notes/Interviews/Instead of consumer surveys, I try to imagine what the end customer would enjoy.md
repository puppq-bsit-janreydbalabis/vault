# Instead of consumer surveys, I try to imagine what the end customer would enjoy

>*Instead of consumer surveys, I try to imagine what the end customer would enjoy. “I don't decide on new products based on consumer surveys or something like that. I try to mentally simulate what the end customer would like, that would want this.  In the case of Starlink, would people buy low-cost, high-bandwidth, fast Internet? Well, yes, obviously.  If you'd listen to surveys, do people want an electric car? There's no way you would start an electric car company because people don't say yes. They're happy with their current car.  I think Henry Ford famously said, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">if you asked people back then what they wanted, they'd say they wanted a faster horse. And they would not have said they wanted an automobile. It's because people don't understand what this new thing is that you're offering. You need to be able to imagine how someone would enjoy the product. If that seems compelling, then I think you should move forward with it</mark>
