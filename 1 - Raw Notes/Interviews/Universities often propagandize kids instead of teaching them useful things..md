# Universities often propagandize kids instead of teaching them useful things.

>*“I do think that too often, people do a university or college thing for four years, and it's unnecessary. They accrue a lot of debt, and it's hard to pay off the debt. And they often don't learn skills that are very useful.  I think we should really reconsider whether going to college actually makes sense. I think it doesn't always.  People also forget, what's the point of going to school in general? You're supposed to learn useful things, improve your understanding of the world, and learn skills that can help you contribute to your fellow human beings.  But very often, a university does the opposite. It will propagandize kids and not teach them anything useful, and just saddle them with a lot of debt.  So, I think, what really matters is, are you doing something useful to help your fellow human beings? Are you contributing more than you take? If you are, that's a great thing.”
