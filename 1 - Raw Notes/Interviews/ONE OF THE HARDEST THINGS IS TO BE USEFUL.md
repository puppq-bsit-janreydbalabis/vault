# One of the hardest things is to be useful 

>*One of the hardest things to do is to be useful.  To have high utility under the curve.  How much help did you provide to each person on average?  Then, how many people did you help?  The total utility.  Trying to actually ship useful products that people like to a large number of people is so insanely hard.  It boggles the mind. This why I say there's a hell of a difference between a company that has shipped product and one that has not shipped product.  This is night and day.  Then, even once you ship product, can you make the value of the output worth more than the cost of the input, which is, again, insanely difficult, especially with hardware.
