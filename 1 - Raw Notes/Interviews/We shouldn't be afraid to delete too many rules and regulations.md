# We shouldn't be afraid to delete too many rules and regulations

>*We shouldn't be afraid to delete too many rules and regulations. “People are often afraid to delete things. I'm like, well, let's just go ahead and do it. If you're not putting a little bit back in, you're not deleting enough.  I think this is a very big deal. You should over-delete rules and regulations, and you'll end up putting a few back, and that's fine.”
