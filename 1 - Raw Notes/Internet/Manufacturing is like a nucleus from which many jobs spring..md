# Manufacturing is like a nucleus from which many jobs spring.

>*“There's a reason why generally, politicians really try very hard to get a factory in their area. It's because it's a massive generator of jobs. For every factory job, there's roughly five support jobs. Teachers, electricians, plumbers, lawyers, accountants, restaurants. So, manufacturing is like a nucleus from which many jobs spring. That's why it's generally governors and prime ministers and presidents will try so hard to get a factory in their country or region.”
