# Get rid of unnecessary complexity

>*One of the hardest habits for an engineer to get rid of is adding unnecessary complexity to what theyâ€™re building. We add complexity and abstractions to systems because it may feel clever even though it may create a whole new set of problems. The past few weeks have really made me reconsider my approach to engineering and how to question every requirement/constraint before adding more complexity or optimizing any system.
