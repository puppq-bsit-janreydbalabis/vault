# It's not about the money, it's about working with talented people to do good things in this world

>*It's not all about money â€” in fact often the money is the least important bit. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">It's about people using their skills and figuring out ways to use the assets of their businesses to drive not only profits but a better world</mark>. Writing a cheque might impact hundreds of people's lives; mobilizing your whole business to drive change can impact millions of lives, and give a whole new life purpose to all the people who work in your company.
