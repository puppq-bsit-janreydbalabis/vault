# Don't be so reluctant to fire people, just fire them

>*Musk says in response that people such as Straubel and McNeill were too reluctant to fire people. In that area of the factory, things had not been working well. Parts were piling up by the workstations, and the line wasn't moving. "By trying to be nice to people," Musk says, "You're actually not being nice to the dozens of other people who are doing their jobs well and will get hurt if I don't fix the problem on the spots."
