# Its necessary to get rid of a man as soon as he thinks himself an expert

>*None of our men are "experts". We have unfortunately found it necessary to get rid of a man as soon as he thinks himself an expertâ€”**because no one ever considers himself expert if he really know his job**. A man who knows a job sees so much more to be done than he has done, that he is always pressing forward and never gives up an instant of thought to how good and how efficient he is. Thinking always ahead., thinking always of trying to do more, brings a state of mind in which nothing is impossible. The moment one gets into the "expert" state of mind a great number of things become impossible
