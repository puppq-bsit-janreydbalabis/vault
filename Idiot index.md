# Idiot index

>*Musk had deployed what he called "idiot index." That was the ratio of the total cost of a component to the cost of its raw materials. Something with a high idiot index—say, a component that cost $1,000 when the aluminum that composed it cost only $100—was likely to have design that was too complex or a manufacturing process that was too inefficient. As Musk put it, "If the ration is high, you're and idiot "

Reduced the ratio as close to 1:1
